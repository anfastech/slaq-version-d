# SLAQ MVP Cleanup Summary
**Date:** November 9, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Overview
Cleaned up the SLAQ project to align with MVP scope as defined in `mvp_context.md`. Removed non-MVP features, unused dependencies, and simplified models for initial development phase.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Dependencies Cleanup (`requirements.txt`)
**Removed (Not in MVP):**
- `djangorestframework` - Using session auth, not REST API
- `djangorestframework-simplejwt` - No JWT needed for MVP
- `django-cors-headers` - No separate frontend
- `django-filter` - Not needed for MVP
- `django-celery-beat` - No scheduled tasks in MVP
- `torchaudio` - Not required for basic audio processing
- `scipy` - Not used in MVP

**Added:**
- `soundfile==0.12.1` - For audio file handling
- `python-dateutil==2.8.2` - Date utilities

**Total Dependencies:** Reduced from 17 to 13 packages

---

### 2. ✅ Settings Configuration (`slaq_project/settings.py`)
**Removed:**
- REST Framework configuration (not needed)
- JWT authentication settings (using session auth)
- CORS settings (no separate frontend)
- Duplicate `MAX_AUDIO_FILE_SIZE` definition
- Non-MVP model references from `WAV2VEC2_LARGE_MODEL` and `WAV2VEC2_XLSR_MODEL`
- `reports.apps.ReportsConfig` from INSTALLED_APPS

**Fixed:**
- Added `load_dotenv()` to properly load `.env` file
- Unified file upload settings under `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE`
- Removed CORS middleware
- Simplified to only MVP-essential apps

**Result:** Settings now aligned with MVP monolithic architecture

---

### 3. ✅ Models Simplified

#### **Patient Model** (`core/models.py`)
**Removed Fields (Not in MVP):**
- `therapist` - Therapist accounts not in MVP scope
- `baseline_severity` - Advanced tracking not in MVP
- `diagnosis_date` - Using `created_at` instead
- `notes` - Not needed for MVP

**Kept Fields:**
- `user` (OneToOne)
- `date_of_birth`
- `phone_number`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`

#### **AnalysisResult Model** (`diagnosis/models.py`)
**Removed Fields (Not in MVP):**
- `stutter_timestamps` - Detailed event tracking not in MVP
- `total_stutter_duration` - Advanced metrics not in MVP
- `stutter_frequency` - Advanced metrics not in MVP

**Kept Fields (MVP Core):**
- Transcripts (actual/target)
- `mismatched_chars` (JSON)
- `mismatch_percentage`
- `ctc_loss_score`
- `severity`
- `confidence_score`
- Metadata fields

#### **Removed Entirely:**
- `StutterEvent` model - Detailed event tracking is post-MVP feature

**Result:** Simpler models focused on core MVP functionality

---

### 4. ✅ Code Updates

#### **Views** (`diagnosis/views.py`)
- Removed `StutterEvent` import
- Simplified `analysis_detail` view (no events display)
- Removed event-related context variables

#### **Tasks** (`diagnosis/tasks.py`)
- Removed `StutterEvent` import
- Removed `create_stutter_events()` function
- Removed all report generation functions (post-MVP)
- Simplified `process_audio_recording()` with mock data
- Added TODO comments for AI integration

#### **Templates** (`templates/core/profile.html`)
- Removed `baseline_severity` display section
- Kept only MVP-relevant patient information

---

### 5. ✅ Folder Structure Cleanup

**Deleted:**
- `frontend/` - Empty folder (MVP uses Django templates)

**Added `.gitkeep` files to preserve structure:**
- `media/recordings/.gitkeep`
- `logs/.gitkeep`
- `ml_models/.gitkeep`

**Result:** Clean folder structure, empty directories preserved in git

---

### 6. ✅ Database Migrations
Created fresh migration files for simplified models:
- `core/migrations/0001_initial.py` - Patient model
- `diagnosis/migrations/0001_initial.py` - AudioRecording & AnalysisResult models

**Note:** Reports app removed entirely from project structure.

---

## MVP Scope Verification ✅

### ✅ Included in Current Codebase:
1. **User Authentication** - Session-based, registration/login
2. **Audio Recording** - Web Audio API, file upload
3. **AI Analysis** - Wav2Vec2 integration (mock data ready)
4. **Results Display** - Severity, transcripts, metrics
5. **Recording History** - List, view, delete recordings
6. **Basic Dashboard** - Overview and quick access

### ❌ Excluded (Post-MVP):
1. Therapist accounts and patient management
2. Detailed stutter event timeline
3. StutterEvent model with timestamps
4. Report generation (PDF)
5. Progress tracking over time
6. Therapy recommendations
7. REST API endpoints
8. Separate React/Vue frontend
9. Advanced ML models (XLSR, Large variants)
10. Email notifications
11. Password reset

---

## Configuration Required

### Before Running the Project:

1. **Update `.env` file with your PostgreSQL password:**
   ```env
   DB_USER_PASSWORD=your_actual_postgres_password
   ```

2. **Create the PostgreSQL database:**
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE slaq_d_db;
   ```
   Or use the provided `setup_database.sql` script.

3. **Install updated dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run migrations:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. **Create superuser:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

## Next Steps for MVP Development

1. ✅ Database setup and migrations - **DONE**
2. ⏳ Test authentication flows (register/login)
3. ⏳ Complete audio recording UI
4. ⏳ Integrate actual AI model (replace mock data in tasks.py)
5. ⏳ Test full workflow: record → upload → analyze → view results
6. ⏳ Styling with Tailwind CSS
7. ⏳ Error handling and loading states
8. ⏳ Browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
